        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Everyone knows and likes <em>sushi rolls</em>. However, sushi is expensive, so I created a cheap, quick recipe.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 cucumber</li>
            <li>4 cups Japanese sushi rice</li>
            <li>12 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
            <li>Wasabi paste</li>
            <li>12 sheets nori </li>
            <li>500 g smoked salmon, cut into long strips</li>
            <li>2 avocados sliced</li>
            <li>Other side dishes are also possible</li> 
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Soak the rice for 4 hours. Drain the rice and cook it in a rice cooker with two cups of water. 
                Rice should be slightly dry because vinegar will be added later.</li>
            <li>Place a sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat, and then put a thin layer of cool rice on the seaweed, 
                leaving at least a half-inch of the top and bottom of the seaweed uncovered. </li>   
            <li>Sprinkle some wasabi on the rice, then place the smoked salmon, cucumber, 
                and avocado on the rice about an inch from the bottom edge of the seaweed.</li> 
            <li>Moisten the top edge of the seaweed slightly. Then, roll it up tightly from the bottom to the top edge using the bamboo mat. 
                Divide the salmon roll into eight equal portions.</li>
        </ol>
